# IPFS
# 🌐 IPFS + Blockchain Integration Project

This repository contains a project demonstrating how to integrate the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** with **Blockchain** technology to store and retrieve decentralized content. It was developed as part of the academic curriculum for the Blockchain subject.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In traditional blockchains, storing large files is inefficient and costly. This project uses **IPFS** to store files off-chain on the blockchain, allowing for secure, verifiable, and decentralized file access.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- 🔗 **Solidity** – Smart contract programming
- 🧠 **Ethereum / Remix IDE** – Smart contract deployment
- 🗃️ **IPFS (via web3.storage / infura / pinata)** – Decentralized file storage
- 🌐 **JavaScript / HTML / Web3.js** – Frontend (if applicable)

---

## 🧪 Features

- Upload files to IPFS and retrieve the content identifier (CID)
- Store the IPFS CID in a smart contract
- Retrieve file links using stored CIDs
- Ensures off-chain storage with on-chain verification
